# ~Bomberman~

This is a remake of the classic franchise done in C using ASCII graphics and ncurses library.

The game features 2 modes:

* Story mode, featuring 15 levels across 3 different zones.

* Battle mode, which is a classic Free for All arena supporting up to 8 players in the same game.

The project was made for a freshman year class by a group of three students.
