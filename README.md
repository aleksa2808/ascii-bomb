# \~Bomberman\~

This is a remake of the classic franchise done in C using ASCII graphics with the pdcurses library.

The game features 2 modes:

* Story mode, featuring 15 levels across 3 different zones.

* Battle mode, which is a classic Free for All arena supporting up to 8 players in the same game.

The project was made for a freshman year class by a group of three students.

# Installation

The game currently only runs on Windows, and was built using Visual Studio 2010 (most recently tested using VS2017). 
From there, it can be compiled out-of-the-box as the required pdcurses lib is already compiled and included.
